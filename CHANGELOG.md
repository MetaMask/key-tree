### Uncategorized
- keccak@3.0.2 ([#31](https://github.com/MetaMask/key-tree/pull/31))

## [3.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Refactor package API ([#25](https://github.com/MetaMask/key-tree/pull/25))
  - The new API is designed to make it harder to derive incorrect keys.
  - The previous exports of this package can no longer be accessed from the main entry file.
  - For the new API, please see [the README](https://github.com/MetaMask/key-tree/blob/1743ef1bb2ca4603c6e2861b975bf2b4d60a0dbc/README.md).
- **BREAKING:** Bump minimum Node.js version to >=12.0.0 ([#20](https://github.com/MetaMask/key-tree/pull/20))

### Security
- Add reference implementation tests ([#25](https://github.com/MetaMask/key-tree/pull/25))
  - The key derivation of this package is now tested against the BIP-32 specification and [`ethereumjs-wallet`](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-wallet) and [`@metamask/eth-hd-keyring`](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-hd-keyring).
  - The key derivation was found to be sound.

## [2.0.1] - 2021-02-27
### Fixed
- Correctly type `deriveKeyFromPath` `parentKey` param as optional ([#14](https://github.com/MetaMask/key-tree/pull/14))
